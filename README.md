# SVAUnit

**SVAUnit** is a UVM-compliant verification framework designed to simplify the **creation of stimuli and checkers** for validating **SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)**.

This project is a **revival and major refactor** of the original open-source [SVAUnit](https://github.com/amiq-consulting/svaunit) framework developed by AMIQ Consulting. Since **January 2025**, this version has been actively maintained, modernized, and extended with new features and a test-driven development focus.
